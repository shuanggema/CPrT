Algorithm
-------
Clustering of prevanlance trend


Usage
-------
1.	cluster_fun: implements the clustering methods. The output is a list whose first element is the list of clusters and second element is a plot to visualize the clusters
2.	cluster_FDA_fun: contains all related functions that are required to implement the proposed algorithm
3.	data.csv and data2.csv: functional data with each row corresponding to a function
4.	pos.csv: contains the time points for the functions in data.csv and data2.csv
